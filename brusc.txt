Absolutely — here’s a **15-line summary of a Nuclear Survival 

---

1. **Stay informed**: Know the threat level via official alerts (radio, apps, emergency broadcasts).  
2. **Have a plan**: Know where to shelter, how to contact loved ones, and evacuation routes.  
3. **Build an emergency kit**: Include water, food, flashlight, batteries, radio, meds, first aid.  
4. **Shelter immediately**: The best protection is deep inside buildings, away from windows.  
5. **Go underground if possible**: Basements. or underground garages provide better radiation shielding.  
6. **Seal your shelter**: Close windows, doors, vents, and seal cracks, with duct tape and plastic.  
7. **Stay inside for at least 24–48 hours**: Radiation is strongest in the first hours after a blast.  
8. **Remove contaminated clothing**: Seal in a bag and shower thoroughly with soap and water.  
9. **Avoid contaminated food and water**: Use only sealed supplies or those stored safely indoors.  
10. **Limit radiation exposure**: Time, distance, and shielding are key (stay longer, farther, behind walls).  
11. **Listen to authorities**: Wait for official clearance before leaving shelter.  
12. **Don't touch fallout dust**: It's radioactive — keep it outside and off your body.  
13. **Have potassium iodide (KI) pills**: Helps protect your thyroid from radiation (if advised). jgh
